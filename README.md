## Introduction

In the era of digital information, distinguishing between real and fake news has become crucial. This project utilizes cutting-edge NLP techniques and LLM models to automatically classify news articles as real or fake. The model has been trained and evaluated on a comprehensive dataset, achieving an accuracy of over 90%.

## Features

- **High Accuracy**: Exceeds 90% accuracy in detecting fake news.
- **Advanced NLP**: Utilizes state-of-the-art NLP techniques for text analysis.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple interface for inputting news articles and receiving classification results.
- **Extensible**: Easy to extend with new models and datasets.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/fake-news-detection.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd fake-news-detection
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To use the fake news detection model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your news article in a text file.
2. Run the detection script:
    ```bash
    python detect_fake_news.py --input your_article.txt
    ```
3. The output will indicate whether the news article is real or fake.

## Model

The fake news detection model is built using the following components:

- **Preprocessing**: Text cleaning and normalization.
- **Feature Extraction**: Using techniques like TF-IDF, word embeddings, etc.
- **Model Training**: Leveraging LLMs like BERT, GPT, etc.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance evaluated on a labeled dataset with accuracy metrics.

## Results

The model has been tested on a diverse dataset of news articles and has achieved an accuracy exceeding 90%. This high level of accuracy demonstrates the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between real and fake news.
